# Moral Welfare House Activity Helper
A simple and customizable toolkit developed to support volunteer sessions at the Moral Welfare House, Singapore.

## Background
As volunteers at the Moral Welfare House, we organize biweekly sessions designed to engage seniors and help prevent cognitive impairment through interactive activities. Regularly, we incorporate simple numerical and cognitive games like Sudoku to stimulate cognitive activity. However, creating custom Sudoku and other games manually using slides or tables was repetitive and inefficient.

This project initially automates the creation of customized Sudoku, future updates will include additional games to diversify engagement and further support cognitive health

## Credits
The Sudoku puzzle generation logic used is inspired from [mayerui's open-source Sudoku repository](https://github.com/mayerui/sudoku). Special thanks for providing an excellent foundation.
